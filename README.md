# High-Dimensional Dataset Analysis

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of sampling distribution techniques (Simple Random, Stratified, Systematic) in R, using the RNA-Seq PAN-CAN gene expression dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The analysis explores how different sampling strategies affect statistical properties—mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis—and distributional fidelity (via histograms and QQ plots) in high-dimensional biomedical data, a critical consideration in personalized medicine.
